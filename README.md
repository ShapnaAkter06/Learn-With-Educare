- --Home-- Here I have fetched API by using react router hooks, using map to get data, destructuring and display on UI.
- Every card has a unique id and a dynamic button, by clicking on the button of the card it will open a new page and show the quiz of that card.
- Every quiz have some option. Clicking on the option it will show whether the answer correct or incorrect.
- There is also a eye button in the right corner. By clicking this button it will show the right answer.
- --Statistics-- In this file I have loaded API (same as home page), destructuring the total value and showing on the chart bar.
- --Blog-- : Here I have added some static ques question answer.
